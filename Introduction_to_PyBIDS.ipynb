In order to make this a successful enterprise, it is necessary to have some standards for how the data are named and organized. Historically, each lab has used their own idiosyncratic conventions, which can make it difficult for outsiders to analyze. In the past few years, there have been heroic efforts by the neuroimaging community to create a standardized file organization and naming practices. This specification is called **BIDS** for [Brain Imaging Dataset Specification](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/).\n",

    "[PyBIDS](https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids) is a package to help query and navigate a neuroimaging dataset that is in the BIDs format. At the core of PyBIDS is the `BIDSLayout` object. A `BIDSLayout` is a lightweight Python class that represents a BIDS project file tree and provides a variety of helpful methods for querying and manipulating BIDS files. While the BIDSLayout initializer has a large number of arguments you can use to control the way files are indexed and accessed, you will most commonly initialize a BIDSLayout by passing in the BIDS dataset root location as a single argument. This creates an sqlite database containing information about the BIDS dataset.\n",

    "In our case, except for the T1w anatomical image and a standard space 4D functional image in derivatives for sub-219, the image files are empty.  These empty files will work with BIDSlayout...and they keep the dataset small. \n",
