    "**BIDS**: There has been a growing interest in sharing datasets across labs and even on public repositories such as [openneuro](https://openneuro.org/). To succeed we need standards for naming and organizing data. Historically, each lab has used their own idiosyncratic conventions, which can make it difficult for outsiders to analyze. In the past few years, there have been heroic efforts by the neuroimaging community to create a standardized file organization and naming practices. This specification is called **BIDS** for [Brain Imaging Dataset Specification](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/).\n",

    "[PyBIDS](https://github.com/bids-standard/pybids) is a package to help query and navigate a BIDS neuroimaging dataset. At the core of PyBIDS is the `BIDSLayout` object. A `BIDSLayout` is a lightweight Python class that represents a BIDS project file tree and provides a variety of helpful methods for querying and manipulating BIDS files. While the BIDSLayout initializer has a large number of arguments you can use to control the way files are indexed and accessed, you will most commonly initialize a BIDSLayout by passing in the BIDS dataset root location as a single argument. This creates an sqlite database containing information about the BIDS dataset. BIDS apps (e.g. BIDS Validator, fmriprep etc.) all creating the BIDSLayout database and use it to identify subjects, files, sessions and relevant metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, except for the T1w anatomical image and a standard space 4D functional image in derivatives for sub-219, the image files are empty.  These empty files will work with BIDSlayout...and keep the dataset small. \n",
